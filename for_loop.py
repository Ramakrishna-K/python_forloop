# In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

# üîÅ Basic Syntax:
#  for variable in sequence

# # example 1 Loop through a list

# fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for fruit  in fruits:
#     print(fruit)


# # 2. Using range():

# for i  in range(5):
#     print(i)

# # 3. Loop through a string:

# for letter in "python":
#     print(letter)

# # 4. using break:
# for num in range (10):
#     if  num == 10:
#         break
    # print(num)

# # 5 using continue

# for num in range(5):
#     if num == 3:
#         continue
#     print(num)

# # 6 with else clause:

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# else:
#     print("Loop finished")    

# Nested for loop (loop inside a loop):
for i in range(1,4):
    for j in range(1,4):
        print(f"i={i} , j={j}")
